# Analytics for Astro documentation

These documents describe the public-source, npm-unpublished
`0.1.0-alpha.12` Milestone 2 correction candidate of
`@codeworkslabs/astro-analytics`.

Milestone 2 provides real Fathom, Plausible, Google Analytics 4, Matomo, and Umami adapters for
pageviews and bounded custom events. The runtime provides simultaneous-provider
coordination, exact per-provider outcomes, and provider readiness diagnostics.
No event queue or runtime consent-transition API is implemented.

All five accepted first-stable providers have implementations. The first
doctrine-complete alpha.11 freeze found lifecycle, virtual-referrer,
script-provenance, cleanup, sandbox-receipt, and documentation defects.
Alpha.12 is the bounded correction candidate. It must complete exact-package
consumer qualification and simultaneous internal/external review before any RC
decision.
