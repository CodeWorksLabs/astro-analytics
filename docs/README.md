# Analytics for Astro documentation

These documents describe the public-source, npm-unpublished
`0.1.0-alpha.11` Milestone 2 correction candidate of
`@codeworkslabs/astro-analytics`.

Milestone 2 provides real Fathom, Plausible, Google Analytics 4, Matomo, and Umami adapters for
pageviews and bounded custom events. The runtime provides simultaneous-provider
coordination, exact per-provider outcomes, and provider readiness diagnostics.
No event queue or runtime consent-transition API is implemented.

All five accepted first-stable providers have implementations. Alpha.10
completed package, repository-driven sandbox, browser-runtime, and
provider-side live qualification, but the later doctrine-complete readiness
working review found URL-only completion suppression in the four older
adapters and incomplete observer failure handling in three. Alpha.11 applies
the cross-provider correction. Its exact package has passed clean stock Astro
and Starlight consumer gates; the new freeze must still complete independent
review before any RC decision.
